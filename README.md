# skydiving-altimeter-simulator
This program simulates a skydive. It should help to internalize regular height checks. In later versions, you should be able to practice making decisions in emergency situations.


## ToDo
- add function to toggle between meters and feet
- allow user to turn backlight on and off
- allow user to set different freefallrates for freefly, speedfly etc
- allow user to choose aad type; also make the user turn on aad first
- add function for reserve pull (add buttons for cutaway and reserve handle; also add toggle button for RSL)
- make it a bit of a game, so that the user has to train decision making -> malfunctions; biplane/downplane situation (for example when you pull too low and aad fires)
- give feedback on screen, what went well, how long it took, what could be better etc
- show freefallrate
- when pulling in the acceleration phase, the freefallrate goes up temporarily -> add another pull behaviour or work with percentages from current freefallrate
