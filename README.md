# skydiving-altimeter-simulator
This program simulates a skydive. The values on the altimeter are realistic values when falling in the belly position


# ToDo
-add function to toggle between meters and feet
-allow user to turn backlight on and off
-allow user to set different freefallrates for freefly, speedfly etc
-allow user to choose aad type; also make the user turn on aad first
-add function for reserve pull (add buttons for cutaway and reserve handle; also add toggle button for RSL)
-make it a bit of a game, so that the user has to train decision making -> malfunctions; biplane/downplane situation (for example when you pull too low and aad fires)
-give feedback on screen, what went well, how long it took, what could be better etc
-show freefallrate
